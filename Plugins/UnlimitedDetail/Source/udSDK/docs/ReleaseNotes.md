### Breaking Changes

- udContext_Create is now udContext_CreateLegacy

- udScene_LoadFromServer, udScene_DeleteServerProject and udScene_SetLinkShareStatus need `workspace/project` as pGroupID; this should be null for udServer projects
- udQueryFilter shapes have been merged into udGeometry. Most APIs that used to take the simple shapes can be switched to the udGeometry equivilents easily
- udConvertCustomItem::pReadPointsInt was removed in favour of optimising the pReadPointsFloat path and to provide easier future expansion.

## udSDK 2.1

- New Features
  - Added support for CSG and more advanced geometric shapes

  - Exposed the standard attribute types
  - Exposed information about the attributes that *are* included in the conversion
  - Removed the generic "LiveFeed" project type and added the specific "GTFS" type

- macOS
  - Framework is now able to be signed
  - Added support for the M1

### Breaking Changes

- The sizes of the following structs changed: udSessionInfo, udConvertInfo, udSceneNode
- The udError enumerator was significantly changed. It now contains far more specific error codes and most of the more generic codes were removes.
- udPointCloud_Export returns a fourth argument, a float pointer that will be updated with the export progress; this can be NULL
- udPNT_LiveFeed was removed (The new udPNT_GTFS covers the GTFS version of Live Feeds all other versions are no longer supported)
- All udScene creation functions require a pointer to a valid udContext object as the first argument now, udScene_CreateInMemory, udScene_CreateInFile, udScene_LoadFromMemory and udScene_LoadFromFile

## udSDK 2.0
- Updated and Rebranded `Vault Development Kit` to version 2.0 of `udSDK`.

> Please Note: Nuclideon will continue to port features from udSDK 1.6.5 across which will result in further API changes.

### Breaking Changes (From VDK)
- Everything has been renamed. Mostly this is as simple as anything prefixed with `vdk...` will now be prefixed with `ud...`
  - There are a few exceptions the most notable are;
    - `vdkRenderView` became `udRenderTarget`
    - `vdkQuery` became `udQueryContext`
    - `udRenderOptions` became `udRenderSettings`
    - Many changes in the attributes enums; `vdkAttributeTypeInfo...` to `udATI...` and `vdkStandardAttribute...` to `udStdAttribute...`
- Login now uses email instead of username
- If you need assistance, reach out to info@nuclideon.com

### Breaking Changes (From udSDK <= 1.6.5)
Not all features are available in udSDK 2.0 yet; Reach out to your developer contact so we can focus development where it is required to ensure we meet your requirements moving forward.

- There is no direct upgrade path, the entire core renderer and convert pipelines have been upgraded and not all features are available yet.
- Lots of features may not exist or will exist in a different format.

### Specific changes since VDK0.6.0
- Removed built-in watermark support (still available manually)
- Fixed some LAZ and ASC conversion issues reported by users
- Removed server-side license pooling (login to Nuclideon Servers is still required)
- Optimised login to require less back and forth with the server
- Added support for server-side projects
- Added user utility functions to Register, Change Password and Forgot Password
- Exposed udStreamer information and added a render flag to disable streamer updates after render (ideally 1 update/frame)
- Added preliminary support for storing primitives (currently limited to triangles) in the UDS file
